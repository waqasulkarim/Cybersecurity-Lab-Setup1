# 🖥️ Cybersecurity & Pentesting Lab Setup

**Networkwalks Cybersecurity & Pentesting Lab Setup — Week 1 Project**

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project focuses on setting up a **virtual cybersecurity and penetration-testing laboratory** using VirtualBox and Kali Linux.

The purpose of the lab is to create a controlled environment where cybersecurity tools, network scanning, reconnaissance, vulnerability assessment, and other security-testing activities can be performed safely and repeatedly.

The lab is configured on a private virtual network so that additional machines can be added later and used as targets for authorized security testing.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

The main objectives of this project are to:

- Install and configure VirtualBox.
- Install/import Kali Linux as a virtual machine.
- Create a private **NAT Network** for the cybersecurity lab.
- Configure network connectivity for Kali Linux.
- Assign a consistent IP address to the Kali VM.
- Verify network connectivity and DNS resolution.
- Take a clean VM snapshot for recovery.
- Document the complete setup process.
- Prepare the environment for future cybersecurity projects.

---

## 🛡️ Purpose of the Lab

The lab provides an isolated and controlled environment for cybersecurity learning and authorized security testing.

It can be used for activities such as:

- Network reconnaissance
- Port scanning
- Vulnerability assessment
- Packet analysis
- Web security testing
- Exploitation practice
- Security-tool experimentation

⚠️ **Important:** This laboratory must only be used for systems that you own or have explicit permission to test. Do not use the lab or its tools to attack unauthorized systems.

# 🪜 Lab Setup Procedure

## Step 1 — Install 7-Zip

7-Zip was installed to extract the Kali Linux virtual-machine package, which may be distributed as a `.7z` archive.

**Tool:** 7-Zip

---

## Step 2 — Install VirtualBox

VirtualBox was installed as the hypervisor.

---

## Step 3 — Create the NAT Network

A dedicated NAT Network was created in VirtualBox.

Configuration:

```text
Network Name: NatNetwork
IPv4 Prefix:  10.0.0.0/24
DHCP:         Enabled
IPv6:         Disabled
```

A **NAT Network** was selected because multiple virtual machines connected to the same NAT Network can communicate with one another while also having outbound network connectivity.

This will allow future attacker and target VMs to communicate within the lab.

## Step 4 — Import Kali Linux

The Kali Linux virtual machine was downloaded from the official Kali Linux website and imported into VirtualBox.

The VM network adapter was configured as follows:

```text
Adapter 1
Attached to: NAT Network
Network:     NatNetwork
Adapter Type: Intel PRO/1000 MT Desktop
```

The VM was allocated:

```text
RAM: 2048 MB
```

A shared folder was also configured for transferring required files between the host operating system and the Kali VM.

### Promiscuous Mode

Promiscuous Mode was configured according to the requirements of the lab.

This setting can be useful for certain packet-capture and network-analysis scenarios, but it should not be treated as universally required for basic connectivity or ordinary packet capture.

---

## Step 5 — Configure the Kali Linux Network

The Kali Linux network configuration was checked and configured with a consistent IPv4 address.

Example configuration:

```text
IP Address: 10.0.0.2
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Gateway: 10.0.0.1
DNS: 8.8.8.8
```

A consistent IP address makes it easier to document the lab and reference the Kali machine in future exercises.

### Screenshot

---

## Step 6 — Create a Clean VM Snapshot

After completing the initial configuration, a VirtualBox snapshot was created.

Example snapshot name:

```text
Clean Kali - Network Setup
```

The snapshot represents the clean baseline of the laboratory.

If a future exercise changes or damages the VM configuration, the machine can be restored to this baseline.

DNS:
8.8.8.8
```

# 🐞 Problems Encountered & Solutions

Documenting problems is an important part of the project.

## Problem 1 — Internet Connectivity After Static IP Configuration

After manually configuring the IPv4 settings, Internet connectivity may fail depending on the Kali/NetworkManager configuration.

One workaround used during this lab was:

```bash
sudo nmcli connection modify "Wired connection 1" ipv4.dad-timeout 0
```

The network connection was then restarted/rebooted and connectivity was tested again.

> **Important:** Network interface and connection names may differ between systems. Students should first identify their actual connection name before running an `nmcli` command.

---

## Problem 2 — VirtualBox VT-x / Virtualization Error

The VM initially failed to start because hardware virtualization was disabled in the system firmware/BIOS.

The issue was resolved by:

1. Restarting the computer.
2. Entering BIOS/UEFI settings.
3. Enabling Intel VT-x / hardware virtualization.
4. Saving the configuration.
5. Restarting the computer.
6. Starting the Kali VM again.

After enabling virtualization, the VM started successfully.

# 📸 Evidence Requirements

The repository should contain sufficient evidence that the lab was actually configured.

At minimum, include screenshots showing:

- NAT Network configuration
- Kali Linux network configuration
- VM snapshot
- Additional verification/testing where appropriate

Screenshots should clearly show the relevant configuration and should not contain unnecessary personal information.

# 💡 What I Learned

Through this project, I learned how to create and configure a virtual environment for cybersecurity practice.

The most important concepts I learned include:

### 1. NAT vs NAT Network

A standard NAT configuration and a NAT Network serve different purposes.

A NAT Network allows multiple VMs connected to the same virtual network to communicate with one another while providing network address translation for external connectivity.

This makes it useful for building a multi-machine cybersecurity laboratory.

### 2. Virtual Machine Networking

I learned how VirtualBox virtual network adapters connect virtual machines to different types of networks and how network configuration affects communication between machines.

### 3. Static IP Configuration

I learned how to configure and verify IPv4 addressing, subnet masks, gateways, and DNS settings in Kali Linux.

### 4. VM Snapshots

I learned that a clean snapshot should be created **before performing risky or experimental activities**.

This provides a known-good recovery point for future cybersecurity exercises.

### 5. Documentation

I learned that documenting commands, configuration, screenshots, problems, and solutions is an important part of a professional cybersecurity project.

# 🔐 Security & Ethical Use

This laboratory is intended strictly for:

- Education
- Cybersecurity training
- Authorized testing
- Personal laboratory experimentation

Any scanning, exploitation, password testing, vulnerability assessment, or other security activity must only be performed against systems for which explicit authorization has been obtained.

**Never test unauthorized systems.**

---

# 🚀 Next Project

The laboratory created in this project will be used as the foundation for future cybersecurity exercises.

The next project will focus on:

**Footprinting & Reconnaissance of an Authorized Target**

All reconnaissance activities will be performed only against an approved target and within the defined scope of the internship project.
